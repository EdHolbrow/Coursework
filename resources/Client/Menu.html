    <p>This game is about trying to get the lowest score possible. You get four cards, only two of which you know. <br>
        Each card has a value, numbered cards are worth their value, e.g. 6 of hearts is 6 points. Queens and Jacks  <br>are
        worth 10 points each as well as 10 numbered cards, aces are worth 1 point and Kings and pairs of numbered
        <br>cards are worth 0 points; e.g. a pair of 2s is worth 0 points. At the end of the round the player
        with the  <br>lowest scoring hand wins, so the aim of the game is to memorise what cards you have in order to
        minimise your score.<br> When playing with one person the amount of turns you get depends on the difficulty
        selected, the harder the difficulty the fewer turns you get. </p>
